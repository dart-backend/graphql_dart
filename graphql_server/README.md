Base package for implementing GraphQL servers. You might prefer [`package:angel3_graphql`](https://pub.dev/packages/angel3_graphql), the fastest way to implement GraphQL backends in Dart.

`package:graphql_server2` does not require any specific framework, and thus can be used in any Dart project.

## Ad-hoc Usage

The actual querying functionality is handled by the `GraphQL` class, which takes a schema (from `package:graphql_schema2`). In most cases, you'll want to call `parseAndExecute` on some string of GraphQL text. It returns either a `Stream` or `Map<String, dynamic>`, and can potentially throw a `GraphQLException` (which is JSON-serializable):

```dart
try {
    var data = await graphQL.parseExecute(responseText);

    if (data is Stream) {
        // Handle a subscription somehow...
    } else {
        response.send({'data': data});
    }
} on GraphQLException catch(e) {
    response.send(e.toJson());
}
```

Consult the API reference for more: [`API Document`](https://pub.dev/documentation/graphql_server2/latest/graphql_server2/GraphQL/parseAndExecute.html)

If you're looking for functionality like `graphQLHttp` in `graphql-js`, that is not included in this package, because it is typically specific to the framework/platform you are using. The `graphQLHttp` implementation in `package:angel3_graphql` is a good example: [`graphQLHttp source code`](https://github.com/dukefirehawk/graphql_dart/tree/master/angel_graphql/lib/src/graphql_http.dart)

## Subscriptions

GraphQL queries involving `subscription` operations can return a `Stream`. Ultimately, the transport for relaying subscription events to clients is not specified in the GraphQL spec, so it's up to you.

Note that in a schema like this:

```graphql
type TodoSubscription {
    onTodo: TodoAdded!
}

type TodoAdded {
    id: ID!
    text: String!
    isComplete: Bool
}
```

Your Dart schema's resolver for `onTodo` should be a `Map` *containing an `onTodo` key*:

```dart
field(
  'onTodo',
  todoAddedType,
  resolve: (_, __) {
    return someStreamOfTodos()
            .map((todo) => {'onTodo': todo});
  },
);
```

For the purposes of reusing existing tooling (i.e. JS clients, etc.), `package:graphql_server2` rolls with an implementation of Apollo's
`subscriptions-transport-ws` spec.

**NOTE: At this point, Apollo's spec is extremely out-of-sync with the protocol their client actually expects.**
**See the following issue to track this:**
**<https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/issues/551>**

The implementation is built on `package:stream_channel`, and therefore can be used on any two-way transport, whether it is WebSockets, TCP sockets, Isolates, or otherwise.

Users of this package are expected to extend the `Server` abstract class. `Server` will handle the transport and communication, but again, ultimately, emitting subscription events is up to your implementation.

Here's a snippet from `graphQLWS` in `package:angel3_graphql`. It runs within the context of one single request:

```dart
var channel = IOWebSocketChannel(socket);
var client = stw.RemoteClient(channel.cast<String>());
var server =
    _GraphQLWSServer(client, graphQL, req, res, keepAliveInterval);
await server.done;
```

See `graphQLWS` in `package:angel3_graphql` for a good example: [`graphQLWS source code`](
https://github.com/dukefirehawk/graphql_dart/tree/master/angel_graphql/lib/src/graphql_ws.dart)

## Introspection

Introspection of a GraphQL schema allows clients to query the schema itself, and get information about the response the server expects. The `GraphQL` class handles this automatically, so you don't have to write any code for it.

However, you can call the `reflectSchema` method to manually reflect a schema: [`API Document`](https://pub.dev/documentation/graphql_server2/latest/introspection/reflectSchema.html)

## Mirrors Usage

By default, `dart:mirrors` is not required, but it can be optionally used.

The `mirrorsFieldResolver` can resolve fields from concrete objects, instead of you first having to serialize them: [`API Document`](https://pub.dev/documentation/graphql_server2/latest/graphql_server2.mirrorsmirrorsFieldResolver.html)

You can also use `convertDartType` to convert a concrete Dart type into a `GraphQLType`. However, the ideal choice is `package:graphql_generator2`.
